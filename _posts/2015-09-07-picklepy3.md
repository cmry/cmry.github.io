title: Quicksnip - Pickle Problems in Python 3

Python 3 has been out for quite some time, and it's still notoriously
ignored by the majority of the community. Luckily, all major libraries that I
make use of have already made the small leap and as behaviour has only been
slightly changed I never ran into any Py3 specific issues. Until today, that
is. After writing quite the collection of classes, and storing their
initialized states along with several module-specific objects all in one
container, it was ready to be pickled and transferred. My fingers being crossed
and naive high hopes notwithstanding, after a few lines of log code rolled over the
screen the following presented itself:

```
_pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <class 'dict_keys'>: attribute lookup
dict_keys on builtins failed
```

Having no clue what went wrong yet, I instinctively looked up the error - and
was presented by the dreaded scenario as so well described by xkcd:

![xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wisdom_of_the_ancients.png)

In my case, however, it was just a single dumped log
[snippet](https://paste.openttdcoop.org/peze0kbvt). Crap. The
chances of these dumps being linked in a chat somewhere are way higher than
them actually being traceable. And although this was the case, the [IRC
server](http://irclogs.qmsk.net/channels/openttd/date/2015-02-16?page=4) was
friendly enough to log the conversation. That pretty much saved
my monday morning. Turned out the bug was actually not that complex, and it
has to do with the Py2 to Py3 transition of merging the good old
`dict.iterkeys` commando into `dict.keys`. Let's reproduce:

``` python
>>> class Foo:
...
...     def __init__(self):
...         self.d = {'John': 1, 'Marie': 2}
...         self.k = self.d.keys()
...
>>> x = Foo()
>>> import pickle
>>> pickle.dump(x, open('foo.pickle', 'wb'))
```

Which again yields *_pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <class 'dict_keys'>:
attribute lookup dict_keys on builtins failed*. It didn't occur to me at
first that the `dict_keys` type was hereby converted into a generator. It's
pretty much hidden away in:

``` python
In [1]: type({'John': 1, 'Marie': 2}.keys())
Out[1]: <class 'dict_keys'>
```

In retrospect, this makes a lot of sense as the `iter` method was *intended* to
be a generator version for dealing with big dictionaries. There are very good
reasons why one should not want to pickle a generator. Quoting [Alexandre
Vassalotti](http://peadrop.com/blog/2009/12/29/why-you-cannot-pickle-generators/) :

> Since a generator is essentially a souped-up function, we would need to save
> its bytecode, which is not guarantee to be backward-compatible between
> Python’s versions, and its frame, which holds the state of the generator such
> as local variables, closures and the instruction pointer. And this latter is
> rather cumbersome to accomplish, since it basically requires to make the
> whole interpreter picklable. So, any support for pickling generators would
> require a large number of changes to CPython’s core.

Anyway, problem solved. To make this mistake better recorded I thought I might
as well post it. Hope it helps!
