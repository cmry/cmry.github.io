I'm a [Lecturer](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/chris-emmery) at the [Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.csai.nl/) of Tilburg University. I'm currently the course coordinator for both [Data Processing](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=880254-M-3) (Python course) in context of our [Data Science](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/masters-programmes/data-science-business-and-governance/) master, and [Language & AI](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=JBC090-B-5) (NLP for Data Science course) for our [joint Data Sience](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/bachelors-programs/data-science) bachelor with [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/bachelor-college/bachelor-data-science/). I previously taught [Text Mining](https://mystudy.uvt.nl/it10.vakzicht?taal=N&pfac=FGW&vakcode=880091) and [Spatiotemporal Data Analysis](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=800880-M-3) (both one semester), and [Data Mining](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=880022-M-6) (five years). My previous research involved scientific development of tools for text forensics and online security such as detection of cyberbullying and child grooming, and author profiling. My dissertation mainly focused on privacy and machine-driven security; or how to apply Machine Learning to protect users from exposing latent information through their language use. More broadly, I'm interested in the (ethical) implications and harms of applying Machine Learning in society.


## Academic Background

I obtained my MSc in Human Aspects of Information Technology cum laude at Tilburg University, where I wrote my [master thesis](./publ) under the supervision of [Menno van Zaanen](http://ilk.uvt.nl/menno/main) on discovering trends in societal debates using supervised topic models on online news sources, for which I had the honor of receiving two awards ([Leo Coolen](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/news/chris-emmery-wins-leo-coolen-award-for-his-master-dissertation) & [STIL](https://twitter.com/clipsua/status/563648163761106944)). I pursued my interest in NLP and scientific development for two years on the [AMiCA project](http://www.amicaproject.be/) at [CLiPS](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/) at the University of Antwerp. After, I was offered a researcher/lecturer position at Tilburg University, where I wrote my dissertation between 2017 and beginning of 2022 under the supervision of [Grzegorz Chrupała](http://grzegorz.chrupala.me), [Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/), and [Eric Postma](http://www.ericpostma.nl)—partly inspired by my time at CLiPS, partly pursuing my own research line.


## (Scientific) Development

During a mix of my studies in AI and a minor in (applied) Computer Science, I learned to speak most notably Python, PHP, and Java. During this time, I also became an avid Linux user and, by extension, very enthusiastic about open-source and open-science initiatives. The latter I wrote a [commentary](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-019-00055-w) on, and recently converted into an educational innovation project. During my Masters, I ran a sole proprietorship in web development and data collection, and scripting was a large part of my student assistantship activities. During my PhD, I was (partly) responsible for server maintenance at both research groups, which—combined with my modest home server park—has made me quite comfortable with system administration. All in all, I typed a whole bunch of code for websites, wrappers, and research (tools). I strongly believe all scientific work should not only be completely open and reproducable, but also usable and extendable. A good example of this, is my [W-NUT](https://github.com/cmry/simple-queries) paper), and the associated [tōku](https://onyx.uvt.nl/toku)) demo. More examples can be found [here](https://cmry.github.io/code).


## Personal

Apart from my main activity in life (providing often noisy feedback signals to the developmental marvel that is my son), I enjoy (too) many things outside of academia: heavy music (yearly most frequent albums below, I'm [unfortunately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkCMSrvOTAo) also into vinyl, I play guitar, drums, and some piano), food (cooking and eating, I'm particular fond of (South)-East Asian cuisine, BBQ, stews, and Erwtensoep), video games (RPGs/shooters, but tbf I mostly have an ungodly amount of hours on the EA Skate games), binging [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) shows, and deadlifting in my garage.
