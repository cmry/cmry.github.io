I'm a [Lecturer](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/chris-emmery) at Tilburg University, as well as a joint [PhD candidate](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/people/chris-emmery) doing research for both the [Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.csai.nl/) at Tilburg and [CLiPS](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/) at the University of Antwerp under the supervision of [Eric Postma](http://www.ericpostma.nl), [Grzegorz Chrupała](http://grzegorz.chrupala.me), and [Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/). I previously taught [Text Mining](https://mystudy.uvt.nl/it10.vakzicht?taal=N&pfac=FGW&vakcode=880091) and [Data Mining](https://mystudy.uvt.nl/it10.vakzicht?taal=e&pfac=FGW&vakcode=880022) in context of our [Data Science](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/masters-programmes/data-science-business-and-governance/) master, and before that worked for the [AMiCA project](http://www.amicaproject.be/). My previous research involved scientific development of tools for text forensics and online security such as detection of cyberbullying and child grooming, and author profiling. Currently I'm on two years research time to finish my dissertation, mainly focussing on machine-driven security; or how to apply Machine Learning to protect users from exposing latent information through their language use.


## Academic Background

I obtained my MSc in Human Aspects of Information Technology cum laude at Tilburg University, where I wrote my [master thesis](./publ) under the supervision of [Menno van Zaanen](http://ilk.uvt.nl/menno/main) on discovering trends in societal debates using supervised topic models on online news sources, for which I had the honour of receiving two awards ([Leo Coolen](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/news/chris-emmery-wins-leo-coolen-award-for-his-master-dissertation) & [STIL](https://twitter.com/clipsua/status/563648163761106944)). I pursued my interest for Computational Linguistics for two years (half-contract) in Antwerp, after which I was offered to continue my research and lecture at Tilburg University, where I reside today. I'm mostly interested in the consequences of applying Machine Learning in society; related to privacy and fairness specifically.


## Development

During my studies I learned to speak most notably Python, PHP, and Java, became an avid Linux user and got very enthusiastic about open-source software, and thus open-data and open-science initiatives. I started a sole proprietorship in web development and data collection, and scripting was a large part of my student assistantship activities. All in all, I typed a whole bunch of code for websites, wrappers, and tools. Apart from offering repositories to completely reproduce my research (see e.g. my [W-NUT](https://github.com/cmry/simple-queries) paper), I also like to build demos of my work (e.g. [tōku](https://onyx.uvt.nl/toku)). More details can be found [here](https://cmry.github.io/code).
