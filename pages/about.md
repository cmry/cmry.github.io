I'm a [Lecturer](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/chris-emmery) at the [Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.csai.nl/) of Tilburg University. I'm currently the course coordinator for both [Data Processing](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=880254-M-3) (Python) in context of our [Data Science](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/masters-programmes/data-science-business-and-governance/) master, and [Language & AI](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=JBC090-B-5) for our [joint Data Sience](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/bachelors-programs/data-science) bachelor with [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl/en/education/bachelor-college/bachelor-data-science/). I previously taught [Text Mining](https://mystudy.uvt.nl/it10.vakzicht?taal=N&pfac=FGW&vakcode=880091) and [Spatiotemporal Data Analysis](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=800880-M-3) (both one semester), and [Data Mining](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=880022-M-6) (five years). My previous research involved scientific development of tools for text forensics and online security such as detection of cyberbullying and child grooming, and author profiling. My dissertation focused mainly on privacy and machine-driven security; or how to apply Machine Learning to protect users from exposing latent information through their language use. More broadly, I'm interested in the (ethical) implications and harms of applying Machine Learning in society.


## Academic Background

I obtained my MSc in Human Aspects of Information Technology cum laude at Tilburg University, where I wrote my [master thesis](./publ) under the supervision of [Menno van Zaanen](http://ilk.uvt.nl/menno/main) on discovering trends in societal debates using supervised topic models on online news sources, for which I had the honor of receiving two awards ([Leo Coolen](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/news/chris-emmery-wins-leo-coolen-award-for-his-master-dissertation) & [STIL](https://twitter.com/clipsua/status/563648163761106944)). I pursued my interest in Computational Linguistics and scientific development for two years (half-contract) on the [AMiCA project](http://www.amicaproject.be/) at [CLiPS](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/) at the University of Antwerp. After, I was offered to a researcher/lecturer position at Tilburg University, where I reside today. I wrote my dissertation between 2017 and beginning of 2022—partly inspired by
my time at CLiPS, partly pursuing my own research line—under the supervision of [Eric Postma](http://www.ericpostma.nl), [Grzegorz Chrupała](http://grzegorz.chrupala.me), and [Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/).


## (Scientific) Development

During my studies I learned to speak most notably Python, PHP, and Java, became an avid Linux user and became very enthusiastic about open-source software, and thus open-data and open-science initiatives. I started a sole proprietorship in web development and data collection, and scripting was a large part of my student assistantship activities. At both my research positions I was (partly) responsible for server maintenance, which combined with my modest home server park has made me quite comfortable with system administration. All in all, I typed a whole bunch of code for websites, wrappers, and tools. Apart from offering repositories to completely reproduce my research (see e.g. my [W-NUT](https://github.com/cmry/simple-queries) paper), I also like to build demos of my work (e.g. [tōku](https://onyx.uvt.nl/toku)). More details can be found [here](https://cmry.github.io/code).


## Personal

I enjoy (too) many things outside of academia: heavy music (yearly most frequent albums below, I'm [unfortunately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkCMSrvOTAo) also into vinyl, I play guitar and drums), food (cooking and eating, I'm particular fond of (South)-East Asian cuisine, BBQ, and Erwtensoep), and video games (RPGs/shooters, but tbf I mostly have an ungodly amount of hours on the EA Skate games). If I'm not doing the above I'm most likely hanging out with my son, binging [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/) shows, or deadlifting in my garage.
