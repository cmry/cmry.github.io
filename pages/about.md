I'm a [Lecturer](https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/persons/chris-emmery) at Tilburg University, as well as a [PhD candidate](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/people/chris-emmery) doing research for both the [Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.csai.nl/) at Tilburg and [CLiPS](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/) at the University of Antwerp under the supervision of [Eric Postma](http://www.ericpostma.nl), [Grzegorz Chrupała](http://grzegorz.chrupala.me), and [Walter Daelemans](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~walter/). I previously taught [Text Mining](https://mystudy.uvt.nl/it10.vakzicht?taal=N&pfac=FGW&vakcode=880091) and [Spatiotemporal Data Analysis](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=800880-M-3) and currently teach [Data Processing](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=880254-M-3) (Python) and [Data Mining](https://catalogus.tilburguniversity.edu/osiris_student_tiuprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&collegejaar=2020&taal=en&cursus=880022-M-6) in context of our [Data Science](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/masters-programmes/data-science-business-and-governance/) master, and before that worked for the [AMiCA project](http://www.amicaproject.be/). My previous research involved scientific development of tools for text forensics and online security such as detection of cyberbullying and child grooming, and author profiling. Currently I'm, finishing my dissertation, mainly focusing on privacy and machine-driven security; or how to apply Machine Learning to protect users from exposing latent information through their language use.


## Academic Background

I obtained my MSc in Human Aspects of Information Technology cum laude at Tilburg University, where I wrote my [master thesis](./publ) under the supervision of [Menno van Zaanen](http://ilk.uvt.nl/menno/main) on discovering trends in societal debates using supervised topic models on online news sources, for which I had the honor of receiving two awards ([Leo Coolen](http://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/news/chris-emmery-wins-leo-coolen-award-for-his-master-dissertation) & [STIL](https://twitter.com/clipsua/status/563648163761106944)). I pursued my interest in Computational Linguistics for two years (half-contract) in Antwerp, after which I was offered to continue my research and lecture at Tilburg University, where I reside today. I'm mostly interested in the (ethical) implications of applying Machine Learning in society; related to privacy and fairness specifically.


## (Scientific) Development

During my studies I learned to speak most notably Python, PHP, and Java, became an avid Linux user and became very enthusiastic about open-source software, and thus open-data and open-science initiatives. I started a sole proprietorship in web development and data collection, and scripting was a large part of my student assistantship activities. At both my research positions I was (partly) responsible for server maintenance, which combined with my modest home server park has made me quite comfortable with system administration. All in all, I typed a whole bunch of code for websites, wrappers, and tools. Apart from offering repositories to completely reproduce my research (see e.g. my [W-NUT](https://github.com/cmry/simple-queries) paper), I also like to build demos of my work (e.g. [tōku](https://onyx.uvt.nl/toku)). More details can be found [here](https://cmry.github.io/code).


## Personal

I enjoy (too) many things outside of academia: heavy music (yearly most frequent albums below, I'm [unfortunately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkCMSrvOTAo) also into vinyl, I play guitar and drums), food (cooking and eating, I'm particular fond of (South)-East Asian cuisine, BBQ, and Erwtensoep), and video games (RPGs/shooters, but tbf I mostly have an ungodly amount of hours on the EA Skate games). If I'm not doing the above I'm most likely hanging out with my son, binging Crunchyroll, or deadlifting in my garage.
